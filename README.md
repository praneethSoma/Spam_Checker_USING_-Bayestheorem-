# Spam_Checker_USING_-Bayestheorem
The Spam Checker application is designed to distinguish between spam and legitimate emails using a 
probabilistic classifier based on a machine learning model, Multinomial Bayes theorem and strong
(naive) independence assumptions across the features. The libraries pandas and sklearn are utilized in
the program. Pandas lib, which offers high-performance data structures and data analysis tools, is used 
to load and modify data in the program. Sklearn lib is used to split data into test and training data,
create a model, and assess accuracy
